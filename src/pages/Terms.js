                User hereby acknowledges and understands that all Transactions are mediated entirely by smart contracts and the Ethereum Network, outside of the control of Company and any of Company’s Affiliates. At no point may Company seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any NFTs. NFTs may contain Company’s branding, trademarks and/or other intellectual property owned and created by Company (collectively, the “Branding”). User hereby acknowledges and agrees that all Branding remains the sole and exclusive property of and wholly owned by Company and such Branding shall not be transferred to Users in connection with any Transactions. User has
                no right to use any of the Branding in connection with the sale of any commercial product. Provided that you do not make use of the Art for any illicit or illegal purpose, Company hereby grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license (the “License”) to use,
                copy, and display the NFT and the underlying Art, together with any extensions thereof that you choose to create or use, in any media now known or hereinafter devised or created, solely:

                <li>for commercial use: for creating derivative works for commercial based upon the Art, such as using the Art in connection with various creative works and/or products, including, but not limited to, film, television, animated productions, video games, endorsements, designs, products, merchandising and any other creative activities, which display or represent copies of the Art (each, a “Derivative Work”); and</li>
                <li>
                    as part of a marketplace, third-party website or application (each, a “Platform”) that permits any Transaction or display of any NFT, provided that the Platform verifies on the blockchain each NFT-owner’s rights to such Transaction or display in order to ensure
                    that only the actual owner can approve such Transaction or display such NFT, and provided further that the NFT is no longer visible once removed from the Platform.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Except for the License, Company and its Affiliates retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Branding and Art and is at all times permitted to make use of the Art for the following purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>for creating Derivative Works for commercial and non-commercial purposes; and</li>
                <li>
                    as part of a Platform that permits any Transaction or display of any NFT, provided that the Platform verifies on the blockchain each NFT-owner’s rights to such Transaction or display to ensure that only the actual owner can approve such Transaction or display such
                    NFT, and provided further the NFT is no longer visible once removed from the Platform. In the event that Company enters into an agreement with any third-party in which Company desires to grant exclusivity in connection with any Derivative Work, your rights relating to such Derivative Work shall immediately terminate and you shall cease exploitation thereof and, to the extent possible, you agree to use best efforts to cause any third-party to which you have granted
                    such rights to promptly cease exploitation and terminate any agreements entered into.

            <span className="fs-2 m-2">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:</span>
            <p className="fs-5 m-2">
                Notwithstanding any damages that you may incur, the entire liability of Company and its Affiliates under any provision of these Terms and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you in connection with the Services or one hundred dollars ($100). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Company or its Affiliates be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential
                damages whatsoever (including, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Services, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Services, loss of any gas fees for failed Transactions, any excessive gas fees charged due to Website or smart contract bugs, any loss of any NFT due to Website or smart contract bugs, loss of assets from your wallet, or otherwise in connection with any provision of these Terms), even if Company or its Affiliates has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In such states, each party’s liability
                will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law. Neither Company nor its Affiliates makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Website and/or Services, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Website and/or Services will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Website and/or Services; or (iv) that the Website and/or Services,
                its servers, the Transactions, or communications sent from or on behalf of Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply; but in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to
                the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.

We make no claims or guarantees that your NFT is or will be worth anything. You understand that your NFT has no inherent monetary value, and any such NFT should be treated as nothing more than a fun collectible. Additionally, there should be no expectation that your NFT will create any ancillary value whether monetary or otherwise.
